# Analysis of Kickstarter Data
## Overview of Project 

The purpose of this project is to analyze success rates of Kickstarter campaigns, specifically campaigns under the theater parent category and further, the plays subcategory.

## Analysis and Challenges 
explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

The analysis was performed by looking at the data through two perspectives. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data was disaggregated by ![parent category and launch date](Outcomes_vs_Goals.png). Kickstarter goals were grouped into 12 bands. The first band included goals less than $1,000. The following ten bands increased in increments of $4,999. The last band included goals over $50,000.
