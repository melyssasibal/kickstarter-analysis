# Analysis of Kickstarter Data
## Overview of Project 
This project analyzes Kickstarter campaign data of 4,113 campaigns from 2010 to 2017 across 19 countries. The analysis explores emerging patterns for campaigns under the theater parent category and further, the plays subcategory. Analysis was done through Excel. 
## Analysis and Challenges 
The analysis was performed by looking at the data through two perspectives: theater outcomes based on launch date and play outcomes based on goals.  
#### Analysis of Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data was disaggregated by outcomes and launch date.

In this graph, campaigns in the theater parent category were disaggregated by their outcome (successful, failed, or canceled) and the month of launch. From this perspective, the data shows that the largest proportion, 13 percent, of all successful theater campaigns were launched in May. In contrast, the lowest proportion, four percent, of successful theater campaigns were launched in December. While the highest proportion of failed theater campaigns were launched in July, October, and also May the high number of successful campaigns that launched in May suggest that May would be the best time to launch a Kickstarter campaign for theater fundraisers.   

#### Analysis of Play Outcomes Based on Goals
The data was also disaggregated by subcategory and goal.

Campaign goals were grouped into 12 bands. The first band included goals less than $1,000. The following ten bands increased in increments of $4,999. The last band included goals over $50,000. The graphs shows percentages of play campaign outcomes within each goal band. From this perspective, the highest proportion of successful campaigns, 75 percent, occurred within the less than 1,000 band. In contrast, the highest proportion of failed campaigns, 100 percent, occurred in the 45,000 to 50,000 band. Two bands, 35,000 to 39,999 and 40,000 to 44,999, both have 66 percent successful campaigns. Given that these two bands differ largely from the first band but still have a high proportion of successful campaigns, it is difficult to make assumptions about what this data says about goals and if goals are a predictor of outcome. 

#### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Results 
Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
